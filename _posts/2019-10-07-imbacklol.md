## Stupid

Someone smart once said "Always be the dumbest person in the room." I forget who said it, but it's crucial to development. Being perceived as "dumb" means that those around you will spend more time teaching you, and you will learn faster than anybody else. And it's really fun to be dumb sometimes, ask crazy questions, do crazy things, act a fool. Craziness is a trait of intelligence, those bold enough to act and think are the smartest heroes among us. It's not the kid in the library working day and night on his chemistry lab, or the teacher at Harvard who took 20 years to get a PhD, and it's not even the kid with the glasses who's always got a laptop open with crazy javascript on it. The smartest people are those who are wild, who say weird things, who stand out because they don't act like anybody else, they just are.

Lately I've been trying to figure out who I am. Brandon Dcruz, who is he? It's my last year at RIT and I've gotta start finding employment because I'm broke as hell. And I've got a lot of opportunities in front of me: there's a few advertising jobs in Rochester that need Google AdSense knowledge, there's a dude out in Texas who runs a film company and has worked with DJ Khaled and thinks I'm a "true artist," there are job fairs and web dev jobs, there are films that needs scores, etc. I've been flying for four years through college trying to learn everything I can, absorbing knowledge, twiddling my thumbs in entrepreneurship classes, tedx meetings, band rehearsals, I've just done a lot. I try to do new things whenever I can, because that feeling of being in an unusual environment, communicating differently with people who think differently, I like to live in the present and be in the new.

So, like all people trying to find themselves, I've been listening to lots of Radiohead and drinking lots of Genesee and meditating. I started doing yoga, it's for the wellness part of my degree. I really like it, stretching and breathing and turning and moving the air to your stomach. I didn't really understand meditation until I started doing that, just breathing into my stomach as if I'm sleeping. It works, I feel better than I have in years.

But I still don't know who the fuck I am. And really, does anybody know who they are? Nobody has ever even seen themselves, only reflections in cameras and mirrors. How can you know who you are if you can't even see yourself? I've been thinking about the Allegory of the Cave too. It's that story about the people who grow up in a cave from birth, chained to a wall, watching the opposite cave side unable to move. And there's a bridge above them, where people walk and talk and their shadows project onto the opposite wall, so these chained up people perceive those black figures as reality. One day, one dude breaks free from his chains, and he runs outside and sees a tree and doesn't believe that the tree is reality because all his life he's only known black shadows. I forget how it ends :) I'm simplifying it all a bit too, but it's a poignant piece. In recent times, lots of people have theorized that life is a simulation. It's a wild theory, how do you know for sure that everything around you is real? Can your senses be trusted? You think therefore you are, but how can you know for certain that other people think too? What is real, who is there, where are you?

## Woah, slow down kiddo

Anyways, I think I've found a way to find out who you are, at least a little bit. Even if everything is fake, and the world is just an orb of light and reflections, there's an undeniable force between humans. We love, fight, kiss, slap, shoot, fuck, use, teach, and play with each other. We talk in all sorts of languages and dialects and give meaning to all kinds of random things. The movie theater of your first date, your best friend's favorite flower, books and vinyl, we give them meaning and spread the energy to others, often times without thinking. If I make a joke in public, and a passerby hears it and thinks its funny, I've passed my energy to them and I don't even know. There must be hundreds of thousands of expressions and memories that you've given to hundreds of thousands of people you will never know.

I'm not a physics major, but I had a really good teacher back in high school. Mr. Miller, what a guy. On the first day of class he asked me in front of the entire class "Brandon, why is the sky blue?" And I, like the humorous human being I am, replied "On the third day, God created the heavens." Miller didn't laugh. He went on to talk about reflections, how some people think it's because most of the world is water and the blue color of the oceans are reflecting upwards, but he dismissed it saying that water isn't usually blue. It's a perception. Honestly, I forget why the sky is actually blue, but that concept of reflections is really cool to me because I think energy between humans works the same way.

If you've ever performed in a band, you'll get it. Whatever instrument you play, when you play with others, once everybody's got the piece down, you communicate through phrases and repeats and licks and fills. Once you're good enough, improvisation will just happen, and you'll notice that the effort, the energy you put into your instrument is reflected by your bandmates without any thought or intention, just call and response. Action and reaction, like a ping pong game. And then the crowd reflects it back, screaming moshing dancing. And you'll just play, it's more than muscle memory, it's an expression. Give and take relationships between everybody in the room. And you'll look up from your drumset and smile at the rhythm guitarist and you'll understand that energy is just like light, it moves around and grows and fades and connects people together like a velcro belt. Just as light is perceived through your eyes, energy is perceived through your emotions. When you cry, those around you feel sad. When you laugh, others laugh with you even if the joke is shitty. When you love, others try to match that love, sometimes to an unhealthy degree. Humans have this inherent longing to connect with each other, and it's more powerful than many know.

That's why I act a fool so often. I like making people laugh, and if they think I'm stupid, that's ok because they're happy. I'd rather people perceive me as a dumbass wacko than not notice me at all. I'd rather have people laugh with my stupidity than sit in silence, scrolling, double tapping. I'll be the class clown any day. Often times it leads me to new impossibly outlandish thoughts and experiences, you should give it a try sometime.

Anyways, if you're trying to find out who you are, just look at those around you. Look in their eyes, at their lips, the way they fiddle with their hair or their shoes, their dialects, and most importantly, look at how they look back at you. Just like looking in a mirror, you'll see yourself if you look close enough. And if you see someone stupid smiling back, someone that can't be described through words, then you're doing something right.

Here's a short poem I wrote a few days ago, idk what to call it lol

free will is a for loop<br>
for the early birds in the east<br>
and the night owls on the right<br>

and just as a lantern turns nothing into light<br>
the universe is a couple playing spore on prom night
