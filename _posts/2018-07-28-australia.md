## Hey Again

My flight's been delayed 3 hours and the Sydney Airport's wi-fi is spotty. Why isn't flying easier? It's 2018, air travel should be much faster in boarding, exiting, etc. I bought my roommate a kangaroo scrotum bottle opener for 35 bucks, he'll probably never use it anyways. I found a copy of Jungle by Jungle in a tiny record shop in Melbourne. This trip was surreal.

I moved to the states when I was six, after being born in a small suburb of Melbourne, Victoria called Altona Meadows. It's this tiny space with tiny homes and barbershops and grocery stores that's run down and brimming with old people. I love it, the skies the shutters on the windows to hinder robberies the kids the libraries. This was my first trip in over 5 years, I saw so many relatives and heard so much about what I ate when I was a kid. Flashes of Coles logos and roundabouts popped. The city had so many busking teenagers, covering Ed Sheeran always.

My creative spirit is dwindling, I've started this post and deleted it about 5 times now. I can't figure out the right words for my music, or the right chords. I'm feeling shy and I'm glued to my phone more than ever, taking it out scrolling through the homepages staring at it for a notification a snap a fb poke whatever whenever. It's fucked up. I can't just sit anymore, I fiend off messages like a junkie.

People smiled at me because they've saw me regularly as a 5 year old, but I don't think they really know me, or care for that matter. I'd love to tell them about my dreams, my sex life, my classes, my friends, my records, my club penguin account (rip) but they don't ask. If I ever have distant related kids when I'm younger, I'll ask them everything. What's your favorite movie? I love electronic music, got any recommendations? Ever been to a party? Ever done drugs? Why? Do you like your life? Why not?

I want to speak and say things and sing and play but I'm forgetting how. The callouses on my fingers are fading, my nails are getting long. I forgot my capo on my grandpa's guitar, he's gonna mail it next week but I might just buy a new one anyways. My cousin gave me an old electric guitar, I have to name her. I'll buy an amp when I'm back up in Rochester, learn some power chords, make some ethereal stuff. I think it'll change my sound if I do it correctly.

How do you make friends on an airplane?
